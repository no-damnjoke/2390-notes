    "\n",
    "A collapse in U.S. housing prices helped trigger a severe economic meltdown in the fall of 2008. One of the contributing factors was that many homeowners had taken on mortgages that ended up having unexpected consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning, mortgages were relatively simple beasts. One borrowed money from a bank and made a ***fixed-size payment each month*** for the life of the mortgage, which typically ranged from fifteen to thirty years. At the end of that period, the bank had been paid back the initial loan (the principal) plus interest, and the homeowner owned the house “free and clear.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the end of the twentieth century, mortgages started getting a lot more complicated. People could get lower interest rates by paying ***“points”*** at the time they took on the mortgage. \n",
    " * A point is a cash payment of 1% of the value of the loan. \n",
    " * People could take mortgages that were “interest-only” for a period of time. That is to say, for some number of months at the start of the loan the borrower paid only the accrued interest and none of the principal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other loans involved ***multiple rates***. Typically the initial rate (called a **“teaser rate”**) was low, and then it went up over time. Many of these loans were variable-rate—the rate to be paid after the initial period would vary depending upon some index intended to reflect the cost to the lender of borrowing on the wholesale credit market."
